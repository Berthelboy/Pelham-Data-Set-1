#We believe that accelerating students in 7th grade has a negative impact on the non accelerated students.
#Since the 6th and 7th grade test scores have different scaled scores, I normalized the data by dividing all
#students test scores by the average for the grade level (these are the 7Norm, 6Norm and 5Norm columns).
I ran a t test with 2 means.

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  not_accel7$X7.Norm and not_accel6$X6.Norm
t = 0.24766, df = 48.87, p-value = 0.8054
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.03004576  0.03849191
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
0.9370500 0.9328269 
#Since the p-value of .8054 > .0385 we can reject the null hypothesis that the two means are equal.
