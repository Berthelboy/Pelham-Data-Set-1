#Does accelerating students improve their performance
#The null hypothesis is that the students in 7A have a normalized score on the 7th grade test equal to their normalized 6th score on the 6th grade test.
#The alternative hypothesis is that the normalized scores are not equal.

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  seven_A$X7.Norm and seven_A$X6.Norm
t = -0.25212, df = 67.958, p-value = 0.8017
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.02796757  0.02169328
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 1.046760  1.049897 
 Since the p-value = 0.8017 > .0217 we can reject the null hypothesis.
