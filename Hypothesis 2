#In Pelham Hutchinson school is considered the weaker Elementary school. 
#To test this I will compare the mean 5th grade score of Hutchinson to that of all students.
#The null hypothesis is that the means are equal.
#The alternative hypothesis is that the means are not equal.

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  hutch_only$Grade.5 and accel$Grade.5
t = -1.2239, df = 35.738, p-value = 0.229
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -22.091658   5.465727
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 325.8182  334.1311 
 Sincethe p-value of .229 < 5.4657 we fail to reject the null hypothesis that hutch has a mean 5th grade score equal to the rest of the district.
