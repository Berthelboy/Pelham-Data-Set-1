# Pelham-Data-Set-1
This is data from my students in the 17 18 school year.  This shows their NYS Grade 5, 6 and 7 test scores
It also shows whether the students were accelerated and what their elementary school they attended.
I am interested to see whether accelerating the students in 7th grade impacted the state test scores.
Does the elementary school they attend impact their 5th grade scores?
Are students from certain elementary schools better prepared for 6th grade?
Does the prior year's state test score indicate performance for the next year?
